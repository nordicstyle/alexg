## Brief biography

Alex Kendall is a Research Fellow at [Trinity College](https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom.
He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering with First Class Honours in 2013 from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/), New Zealand.
In 2014, he was awarded a [Woolf Fisher Scholarship](http://www.woolffishertrust.co.nz/) to study towards a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge.
He is a member of the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/CVR) and is supervised by [Prof. Roberto Cipolla](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~cipolla/).

Alex's research investigates applications of deep learning to robotic perception and control.
He has developed computer vision algorithms to allow autonomous vehicles to understand complex and dynamic scenes.
In particular, he is excited about leveraging geometry for unsupervised learning, reasoning under uncertainty with Bayesian deep learning and developing end-to-end systems which can reason from perception to control.
His technology has been used to power smart-city infrastructure with [Vivacity](http://www.vivacitylabs.com/), control self-driving cars with [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/) and enable next-generation drone flight with [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/).
